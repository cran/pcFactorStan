\description{
Imagine that there are people that play in tournaments of more than
one board game. For example, the computer player AlphaZero (Silver
et al. 2018) has trained to play chess, shogi, and Go. We can take
the tournament match outcome data and find rankings among the
players for each of these games. We may also suspect that there is
a latent board game skill that accounts for some proportion of the
variance in the per-board game rankings.

\section{Response model}{


The paired comparison item response model has thresholds and a
scale parameter similar to the partial credit model (Masters,
1982). The model is cumbersome to describe in traditional
mathematical notation, but the R code is fairly straightforward,

\preformatted{
softmax <- function(y) exp(y) / sum(exp(y))

cmp_probs <- function(scale, alpha, pa1, pa2, thRaw) {
  th <- cumsum(thRaw)
  diff <- scale * (pa2 - pa1)
  unsummed <- c(0, diff + rev(th), diff - th, use.names = FALSE)
  softmax(cumsum(alpha * unsummed))
}
}

The function \code{cmp_probs} takes a \code{scale} constant,
\code{alpha} discrimination, the latent scores for two objects
\code{pa1} and \code{pa2}, and a vector of thresholds
\code{thRaw}. The thresholds are parameterized as the difference
from the previous threshold. For example, thresholds c(0.5, 0.5)
are not at the same location but are at locations c(0.5,
1.0). Thresholds are symmetric. If there is one threshold then the
model admits three possible response outcomes (e.g. \emph{win}, \emph{tie}, and
\emph{lose}). Responses are always stored centered with zero representing
a tie. Therefore, it is necessary to add one plus the number of
thresholds to response data to index into the vector returned by
\code{cmp_probs}. For example, if our response data is (-1, 0, 1)
and has one threshold then we would add 2 (1 + 1 threshold) to
obtain the indices (1, 2, 3).

Use \code{\link{itemModelExplorer}} to explore the item model. In
this \pkg{shiny} app, the \emph{discrimination} parameter does what
is customary in item response models. However, it is not difficult
to show that discrimination is a function of thresholds and
scale. That is, discrimination is not an independent parameter.  In
paired comparison models, discrimination and measurement error are
confounded.

\section{Backward incompatibility}{

The function \link{generateFactorItems} was renamed to
  \code{generateSingleFactorItems} (version 1.1.0) to make space for a more
  flexible factor model with an arbitrary number of factors and
  arbitrary factor-to-item loading pattern. If you don't need this
  flexibility, you can call the old function \link{generateSingleFactorItems}.
