\title{A Shiny app to experiment with the item response model}
\usage{
itemModelExplorer(dl = NULL, fit = NULL, item = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dl}{a data list prepared by \code{\link{prepData}}}

\item{fit}{a \code{\link[rstan:stanfit-class]{stanfit}} object}

\item{item}{name of the item to visualize}
}
\description{
When data \code{dl} and fitted model \code{fit} are provided, the
item parameters associated with \code{item} are loaded for
inspection.

\section{Response model}{


The paired comparison item response model has thresholds and a
scale parameter similar to the partial credit model (Masters,
1982). The model is cumbersome to describe in traditional
mathematical notation, but the R code is fairly straightforward,

\preformatted{
softmax <- function(y) exp(y) / sum(exp(y))

cmp_probs <- function(scale, alpha, pa1, pa2, thRaw) {
  th <- cumsum(thRaw)
  diff <- scale * (pa2 - pa1)
  unsummed <- c(0, diff + rev(th), diff - th, use.names = FALSE)
  softmax(cumsum(alpha * unsummed))
}
}

The function \code{cmp_probs} takes a \code{scale} constant,
\code{alpha} discrimination, the latent scores for two objects
\code{pa1} and \code{pa2}, and a vector of thresholds
\code{thRaw}. The thresholds are parameterized as the difference
from the previous threshold. For example, thresholds c(0.5, 0.5)
are not at the same location but are at locations c(0.5,
1.0). Thresholds are symmetric. If there is one threshold then the
model admits three possible response outcomes (e.g. \emph{win}, \emph{tie}, and
\emph{lose}). Responses are always stored centered with zero representing
a tie. Therefore, it is necessary to add one plus the number of
thresholds to response data to index into the vector returned by
\code{cmp_probs}. For example, if our response data is (-1, 0, 1)
and has one threshold then we would add 2 (1 + 1 threshold) to
obtain the indices (1, 2, 3).

Use \code{\link{itemModelExplorer}} to explore the item model. In
this \pkg{shiny} app, the \emph{discrimination} parameter does what
is customary in item response models. However, it is not difficult
to show that discrimination is a function of thresholds and
scale. That is, discrimination is not an independent parameter.  In
paired comparison models, discrimination and measurement error are
confounded.
